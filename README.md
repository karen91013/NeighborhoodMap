# Neighborhood Map
This a project completed in React for Udacity's Front-End Web Developmer Nanodegree course. I built a single page application to show different prominent parks around the United States, their location and weather details at each location. Implemented two third-party APIs to provide additional information about each of these locations.

# To Start
To get started:

* Install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* Start the development server with `npm start`

# Contributing
* This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
* APIs used: Google Maps API, Dark Sky API

# Service Worker
Service worker is not needed for this application. I have created a project with create-react-app and thus it is invoked by default. 

To test in production: 
* Open terminal
* Type 'npm run build'
* Type 'serve build'


# ARIA Roles & Tabindex
Tabbing through the site with the keyboard will select each different city.
