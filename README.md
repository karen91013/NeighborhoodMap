# Neighborhood Map
This a project completed in React for Udacity's Front-End Web Developmer Nanodegree course. I built a single page application to show different prominent parks around the United States, their location and weather details at each location. Implemented two third-party APIs to provide additional information about each of these locations.

# To Start
To get started:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

* APIs used: Google Maps API, Dark Sky API
